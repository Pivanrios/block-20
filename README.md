# DOM manipulation
We access our web page thru our queryselector and start creating and *appending* our elements to the page. The DOM allows us to read the source file and than manipulate it within memory with JavaScript.

##foreach( )
with the .foreach() method we can go thru the objects on our users array and change the innerText of our li elements.

##console
we use the console on our devtools to get feedback of our code, to check if its running correctly.
